Below are the steps for running the application.

1. Download the file from GITHUB and import into Eclipse IDE (preferably latest version of IDE).
2. Right click -> Run as -> Run on Server -> Add Tomcat server (I have used Tomcat version 8).

4. If the default page is not displayed, please try to open the below URL in the browser.
